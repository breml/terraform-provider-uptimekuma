# PEP 0010: Add Push Monitor Resource

Extend the Terraform provider to support Push monitor resources of Uptime Kuma. This will involve creating a new resource for Push monitors and updating the provider schema to include this resource.

## Overview

Push monitors work differently from other monitor types. Instead of the Uptime Kuma server actively checking a resource, the monitored service or system pushes status updates to Uptime Kuma via a unique URL. If no push is received within the configured interval, the monitor is marked as DOWN.

## Implementation Details

1. **New Resource**: Create a new resource file `resource_monitor_push.go` in the `internal/provider/` directory.

2. **Schema Definition**: Define the schema for the Push monitor resource. The Push monitor extends the base monitor attributes with one additional field:
   - `push_token` (string, computed, read-only): A unique token generated by the Uptime Kuma server. This token is used to construct the push URL: `{baseURL}/api/push/{pushToken}?status=up&msg=OK&ping=`

3. **CRUD Operations**: Implement the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the Push monitor resource using the `github.com/breml/go-uptime-kuma-client` library. The `push_token` field is server-generated during creation and cannot be modified by users.

4. **Testing**: Write acceptance tests for the new resource to ensure it works as expected.

5. **Documentation**: Update the provider documentation to include information about the new Push monitor resource. This will involve adding examples showing how to create a Push monitor and how to export the push URL for use in external systems.

## Technical Notes

- The Push monitor is one of the simplest monitor types, only adding the `push_token` field to the base monitor attributes
- The client library implementation is in `github.com/breml/go-uptime-kuma-client/monitor/monitor_push.go`
- Reference implementation: `resource_monitor_ping.go` (another simple monitor type)
