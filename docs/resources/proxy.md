  Proxy resource for managing HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxies in Uptime Kuma
---

# uptimekuma_proxy (Resource)

Manage proxy configurations in Uptime Kuma. Proxies can be used by monitors to route requests through HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5 proxy servers.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Basic HTTP proxy
resource "uptimekuma_proxy" "http_basic" {
  host     = "proxy.example.com"
  port     = 8080
  protocol = "http"
  active   = true
}

# HTTPS proxy with authentication
resource "uptimekuma_proxy" "https_with_auth" {
  host     = "secure-proxy.example.com"
  port     = 8443
  protocol = "https"
  auth     = true
  username = "proxyuser"
  password = "proxypassword"
  active   = true
}

# SOCKS5 proxy set as default
resource "uptimekuma_proxy" "socks5_default" {
  host     = "socks.example.com"
  port     = 1080
  protocol = "socks5"
  auth     = true
  username = "socksuser"
  password = "sockspass"
  active   = true
  default  = true
}

# Proxy to apply to all existing monitors on creation
resource "uptimekuma_proxy" "apply_to_monitors" {
  host          = "new-proxy.example.com"
  port          = 3128
  protocol      = "http"
  active        = true
  apply_existing = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `host` (String) Proxy server hostname or IP address
- `port` (Number) Proxy server port
- `protocol` (String) Proxy protocol (http, https, or socks5)

### Optional

- `active` (Boolean) Enable or disable the proxy
- `apply_existing` (Boolean) Apply proxy to all existing monitors on creation
- `auth` (Boolean) Whether proxy authentication is required
- `default` (Boolean) Set as the default proxy
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for proxy authentication
- `username` (String) Username for proxy authentication

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) Proxy identifier

## Attribute Details

### Required Attributes

- **`protocol`** - The proxy protocol type. Must be one of: `http`, `https`, or `socks5`. This determines how the proxy server handles connections.

- **`host`** - The hostname or IP address of the proxy server. Can be a domain name (e.g., `proxy.example.com`) or an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

- **`port`** - The port number on which the proxy server listens. Must be a valid port number between 1 and 65535.

### Optional Attributes

- **`auth`** - Boolean flag indicating whether the proxy requires authentication. When set to `true`, both `username` and `password` must be provided. Defaults to `false`.

- **`username`** - The username for proxy authentication. Only used when `auth` is `true`. Must be provided if `auth` is enabled.

- **`password`** - The password for proxy authentication. Only used when `auth` is `true`. Must be provided if `auth` is enabled. Marked as sensitive to prevent accidental disclosure in logs.

- **`active`** - Boolean flag to enable or disable the proxy. When `false`, the proxy is disabled but remains configured. Defaults to `false`.

- **`default`** - Boolean flag to set this proxy as the default proxy for new monitors. Only one proxy should be set as default. Defaults to `false`.

- **`apply_existing`** - Boolean flag to automatically apply this proxy to all existing monitors upon creation. Useful when adding a new proxy that should be used immediately by existing monitors. Defaults to `false`. Note: This flag only applies during resource creation and does not affect subsequent updates.

## Import

Proxies can be imported using their ID:

```hcl
terraform import uptimekuma_proxy.example 1
```

## Notes

- When `auth` is enabled, both username and password are required. The provider will validate that these fields are provided during resource creation and updates.
- The password is stored in Terraform state and marked as sensitive. Ensure your state file is properly secured.
- The `apply_existing` flag only applies during initial creation of the resource. It does not apply the proxy to monitors when updating existing resources.
- Only one proxy can be set as the default (`default = true`). If you set a new proxy as default, consider explicitly setting `default = false` on other proxies to avoid conflicts.
